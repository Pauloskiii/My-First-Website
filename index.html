            My love for Tech knows no bound. I first of all took interst in Software development during my Second year in the Univesity.
            At that time we were offering C++, for the very first time my eyes were opened to the vast world of opportunities that exist in 
            the Technological space and now i'm most keen in exploring that space to find my place in it. My goal is to affect the world by proferring solutions to real world problems.

            <h5>Cyber Security</h5>
            <p>
               Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, 
               mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks.
            </p> 
         </div>
     
         <div id="web">
            <h5>Web development</h5>
            <p>Web development is the process of building websites
                and applications for the internet, or for a private network known as 
                an intranet. Web development is not concerned with the design of a website; rather, 
                it's all about the coding and programming that powers the website's functionality.</p> 
         </div>
     
         <div id="ui">
            <h5>UI/UX</h5>
            <p>UX design refers to the term “user experience design”, while UI
                stands for “user interface design”. Both elements are crucial to a product
                and work closely together. But despite their professional relationship, 
               the roles themselves are quite different, referring to very different aspects of 
               the product development process and the design discipline.</p> 
         </div>
     
         <div id="machine">
            <h5>Machine Learning</h5>
            <p>Machine learning (ML) is the subset of artificial intelligence 
               (AI) that focuses on building systems that learn—or 
               improve performance—based on the data they consume. Artificial 
               intelligence is a broad term that refers to systems or machines that 
               mimic human intelligence. Machine learning and AI are often discussed together,
                and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but they don't mean the same thing.
                 An important distinction is that although all machine learning is AI, 
                 not all AI is machine learning.</p>
